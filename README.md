# First Project - StockTrader

## First Objectives:
-  Somehow identify promising stocks, provide info, benchmarks, graphical data to support it
-  Pull live daily data of the current stock market. Focus on US listed stocks for timing reasons.
-  Issue Buy/Hold/Sell commands
-  Store portfolio data
-  Run backend first on Python and consider speed up later on
-  Some kind of sentiment analysis eventually?
-  Possible to link it to real trader?

## More Meat

#### Somehow identify promising stocks, provide info, benchmarks, graphical data to support it
This can be done two ways:
- Either we start by tracking a predefined list of stocks and only analysing those and trading those
- Or we go head first, and find a way to pull some news/sentiment information and then analyse those stocks in the hope of finding some big movers
